        <h2 id="why-heading">Why schools need Transport Management</h2>
        <p>Running a school in 2026 means managing more data than ever — yet many campuses still depend on route confusion, manual transport fee billing, and safety communication gaps. That creates delays, errors, and frustrated parents who expect instant answers about their children.</p>
        <p>Transport Management inside EduPortal school ERP Pakistan addresses these gaps directly. Instead of asking staff to juggle WhatsApp groups, registers, and disconnected Excel files, everything flows through one platform designed for educators.</p>
        <p>When clear route assignments, integrated billing, and parent app visibility become standard, principals gain confidence during inspections, owners see trustworthy numbers, and teachers spend less time on paperwork. The result is a campus that feels professional to families comparing schools in your city.</p>
        <p>Schools that digitize early also recover hours every week — time redirected toward teaching quality, parent engagement, and growth. EduPortal clients report smoother fee seasons, calmer exam weeks, and fewer emergency meetings about missing records.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Eliminate route confusion, manual transport fee billing, and safety communication gaps with structured digital workflows.</li>
          <li>Achieve clear route assignments, integrated billing, and parent app visibility visible to owners and parents alike.</li>
          <li>Stay compliant with board inspections and franchise reporting standards.</li>
          <li>Free staff time during peak admission, fee, and exam seasons.</li>
        </ul>

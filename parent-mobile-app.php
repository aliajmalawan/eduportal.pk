        <h2 id="why-heading">Why schools need Parent Mobile App</h2>
        <p>Running a school in 2026 means managing more data than ever — yet many campuses still depend on endless phone calls to the office for fee and result updates. That creates delays, errors, and frustrated parents who expect instant answers about their children.</p>
        <p>Parent Mobile App inside EduPortal school ERP Pakistan addresses these gaps directly. Instead of asking staff to juggle WhatsApp groups, registers, and disconnected Excel files, everything flows through one platform designed for educators.</p>
        <p>When informed families, fewer front-desk calls, and stronger school trust become standard, principals gain confidence during inspections, owners see trustworthy numbers, and teachers spend less time on paperwork. The result is a campus that feels professional to families comparing schools in your city.</p>
        <p>Schools that digitize early also recover hours every week — time redirected toward teaching quality, parent engagement, and growth. EduPortal clients report smoother fee seasons, calmer exam weeks, and fewer emergency meetings about missing records.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Eliminate endless phone calls to the office for fee and result updates with structured digital workflows.</li>
          <li>Achieve informed families, fewer front-desk calls, and stronger school trust visible to owners and parents alike.</li>
          <li>Stay compliant with board inspections and franchise reporting standards.</li>
          <li>Free staff time during peak admission, fee, and exam seasons.</li>
        </ul>

            <h2><i data-lucide="help-circle"></i> What is Multi-Campus Management?</h2>
            <p>Multi-Campus Management is a core module of EduPortal — AI-ready school management software Pakistan used by hundreds of campuses. One platform for every branch with consolidated owner visibility. It centralizes workflows that schools previously handled with duplicate systems per campus and delayed group-level reporting, giving every stakeholder accurate information from a single login.</p>

            <h2><i data-lucide="star"></i> Why is Multi-Campus Management important for schools?</h2>
            <p>Multi-Campus Management matters because operational mistakes directly affect student experience and school reputation. When records are late or incomplete, parents lose trust, teachers duplicate effort, and owners fly blind on decisions. EduPortal helps schools professionalize back-office work so education stays the focus.</p>

            <h2><i data-lucide="route"></i> How does EduPortal's Multi-Campus Management work?</h2>
            <p>EduPortal's multi-campus management connects staff dashboards, optional mobile apps, and parent-facing portals. Administrators configure rules once; daily users complete tasks in simple screens; reports and notifications flow automatically to the right people — principals, accountants, teachers, and families.</p>

            <h2><i data-lucide="map-pin"></i> Benefits for schools in Pakistan</h2>
            <p>For schools in Pakistan, multi-campus management must respect local realities: multi-lingual families, WhatsApp as the primary channel, tight fee cycles, and board exam pressure. EduPortal supports Urdu/English workflows, SIM and WhatsApp messaging, PKR billing, and formats familiar to regional education boards — without forcing you to adopt foreign software habits.</p>

        <h2 id="why-heading">Why schools need Multi-Campus Management</h2>
        <p>Running a school in 2026 means managing more data than ever — yet many campuses still depend on duplicate systems per campus and delayed group-level reporting. That creates delays, errors, and frustrated parents who expect instant answers about their children.</p>
        <p>Multi-Campus Management inside EduPortal school ERP Pakistan addresses these gaps directly. Instead of asking staff to juggle WhatsApp groups, registers, and disconnected Excel files, everything flows through one platform designed for educators.</p>
        <p>When central governance, branch autonomy, and unified analytics become standard, principals gain confidence during inspections, owners see trustworthy numbers, and teachers spend less time on paperwork. The result is a campus that feels professional to families comparing schools in your city.</p>
        <p>Schools that digitize early also recover hours every week — time redirected toward teaching quality, parent engagement, and growth. EduPortal clients report smoother fee seasons, calmer exam weeks, and fewer emergency meetings about missing records.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Eliminate duplicate systems per campus and delayed group-level reporting with structured digital workflows.</li>
          <li>Achieve central governance, branch autonomy, and unified analytics visible to owners and parents alike.</li>
          <li>Stay compliant with board inspections and franchise reporting standards.</li>
          <li>Free staff time during peak admission, fee, and exam seasons.</li>
        </ul>

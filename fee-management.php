            <h2><i data-lucide="help-circle"></i> What is Fee Management?</h2>
            <p>Fee Management is a core module of EduPortal — AI-ready school management software Pakistan used by hundreds of campuses. Define fee heads, generate vouchers in bulk, and track every rupee collected. It centralizes workflows that schools previously handled with manual voucher printing, missed concessions, and endless defaulter follow-ups, giving every stakeholder accurate information from a single login.</p>

            <h2><i data-lucide="star"></i> Why is Fee Management important for schools?</h2>
            <p>Fee Management matters because operational mistakes directly affect student experience and school reputation. When records are late or incomplete, parents lose trust, teachers duplicate effort, and owners fly blind on decisions. EduPortal helps schools professionalize back-office work so education stays the focus.</p>

            <h2><i data-lucide="route"></i> How does EduPortal's Fee Management work?</h2>
            <p>EduPortal's fee management connects staff dashboards, optional mobile apps, and parent-facing portals. Administrators configure rules once; daily users complete tasks in simple screens; reports and notifications flow automatically to the right people — principals, accountants, teachers, and families.</p>

            <h2><i data-lucide="map-pin"></i> Benefits for schools in Pakistan</h2>
            <p>For schools in Pakistan, fee management must respect local realities: multi-lingual families, WhatsApp as the primary channel, tight fee cycles, and board exam pressure. EduPortal supports Urdu/English workflows, SIM and WhatsApp messaging, PKR billing, and formats familiar to regional education boards — without forcing you to adopt foreign software habits.</p>

        <h2 id="why-heading">Why schools need Fee Management</h2>
        <p>Running a school in 2026 means managing more data than ever — yet many campuses still depend on manual voucher printing, missed concessions, and endless defaulter follow-ups. That creates delays, errors, and frustrated parents who expect instant answers about their children.</p>
        <p>Fee Management inside EduPortal school ERP Pakistan addresses these gaps directly. Instead of asking staff to juggle WhatsApp groups, registers, and disconnected Excel files, everything flows through one platform designed for educators.</p>
        <p>When accurate billing, faster collections, and clear aging reports for owners become standard, principals gain confidence during inspections, owners see trustworthy numbers, and teachers spend less time on paperwork. The result is a campus that feels professional to families comparing schools in your city.</p>
        <p>Schools that digitize early also recover hours every week — time redirected toward teaching quality, parent engagement, and growth. EduPortal clients report smoother fee seasons, calmer exam weeks, and fewer emergency meetings about missing records.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Eliminate manual voucher printing, missed concessions, and endless defaulter follow-ups with structured digital workflows.</li>
          <li>Achieve accurate billing, faster collections, and clear aging reports for owners visible to owners and parents alike.</li>
          <li>Stay compliant with board inspections and franchise reporting standards.</li>
          <li>Free staff time during peak admission, fee, and exam seasons.</li>
        </ul>
